üìå Project Outline: Analyzing Global Temperature Trends (1995-2019)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to the Project

Overview of the dataset: Geo-Spatial Time-Series Dataset (temperature data across different cities worldwide from 1995 to 2020).
Understanding the importance of climate trends and how they affect different regions.
Objectives:
Identify global temperature trends.
Compare temperature changes across regions and time.
Analyze key patterns, trends, and anomalies in climate data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Loading the dataset and understanding its structure.
Handling missing values (e.g., NaN in State).
Converting temperature units if needed (e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius).
Data formatting: Ensuring Year, Month, and Day columns are in the correct data type.
Handling outliers in temperature records.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Global Temperature Trends (1995-2019)
Overall trend analysis: Is the world getting warmer?
Visualizing yearly temperature changes across the world.
Identifying key moments and anomalies:
Sharp increases or decreases in global temperature.
Notable climate events affecting temperature trends.
Detecting outliers in temperature data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparing Yearly Average Temperature Across Different Regions
Grouping data by Region (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, etc.).
Visualizing regional temperature trends with line charts.
Identifying which regions are experiencing the fastest temperature increases.
Exploring temperature variations across continents.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Monthly Average Temperature in Canada
Extracting data for Canada and analyzing monthly variations.
Comparing seasonal temperature patterns (Winter vs. Summer).
Year-over-year comparison to detect warming trends in Canada.
Creating heatmaps to visualize temperature fluctuations across months.
